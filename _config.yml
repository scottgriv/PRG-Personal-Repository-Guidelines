title: Personal Repository Guidelines (PRG)
description: a system that transforms the way repositories are organized and presented in your GitHub Portfolio. By harnessing the power of GitHub Actions, it automatically crafts a tier-based display, neatly categorizing your repositories for enhanced clarity and impact. Beyond mere organization, it sets forth comprehensive guidelines, templates for READMEs, and overall repository structure, ensuring each project is showcased with maximum professionalism and coherence.
