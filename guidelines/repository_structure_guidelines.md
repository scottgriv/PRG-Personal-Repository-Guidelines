## README File

> [!NOTE] 
> **REQUIRED** file for **ALL** tiers.

- A `README` file describes your project and provides information on how to use it.
- The `README` file should be named `README.md`.
- The `README` file should be located in the root of your repository.   
- Use the templates in the [Template Guide](../templates/template_guide.md) as a starting point for your profile `README` (especially if you're using **PRG**).

> [!TIP]
> Consult the [README Guidelines](readme_guidelines.md) for more resources and information on how to write a `README` file.

## .github/CHANGELOG.md File

> [!NOTE]
> **OPTIONAL** file for **ALL** tiers.

- This file contains a list of changes for each version of your project.
- Use the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format for your changelog.
- Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) guidelines.
    - Given a version number **X.Y.Z** (**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**) (e.g. 1.0.0), increment the:
        - **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes.
        - **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner.
        - **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes.
        - A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes.
        - Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

    - For pre-release and build metadata, use the labels **alpha**, **beta**, **rc**, and **build** using the format **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-label.build**.
    - Examples:
        - 1.0.0-alpha
        - 1.0.0-beta
        - 1.0.0-rc
            - **rc** stands for release candidate, which is a beta version with potential to be a final product, which is ready to release unless significant bugs emerge.
            - **alpha** and **beta** are used for pre-release versions.
            - **build** is used to identify a build.
            - This scheme is not strictly enforced, but it is recommended by the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) specification, highlighted in their 2.0.0 release [here](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html#spec-item-9).

## .gitignore File

> [!NOTE] 
> **REQUIRED** file for **ALL** tiers.

- This file should contain a list of files and folders that should be ignored by Git.
- Its recommended to ignore your vscode workspace files, virtual environment files, build folders, and any sensitive information files.
    - e.g. `.vscode/`, `venv/`, `.env`
- This will dramatically reduce the size of your repository, making it easier to download.

> [!TIP]
> Use the [.gitignore](../.gitignore) file in the root of this repository as a good example and starting point for a .gitignore template for your projects.

> [!NOTE]
> It's good practice to research what the best files are to add to your .gitignore file based on the technology you're using to develop.

## .gitkeep File

> [!NOTE] 
> **OPTIONAL** file for **ALL** tiers.

- Sometimes you may want to include an empty directory as a resource in your project (say, a place to dump image files from an upload process).
- Well, by default, git will ignore empty folders from being uploaded to your repository.
    - This is because git can't track empty directories. It can only track files.
    - Thus, no files/changes, no tracking.
- Adding this file (with no content inside of it), will ensure that git will not ignore the file since a change has taken place.
